A            G
I'm a lazy lover

wasting time
      A            G
then one day this summer

            G
to cut my line

3 years broken hearted
              A                G
but now her ghost is finally gone
      A                 G
I'm done with broken people
         A 
this is me
               G
im workin on

[Refrain]

A G (repeat)
Good to go for wherever I'm needed
bags are packed and they're
down by the door
you can take all the tricks up my sleeve
                      E
i dont need them any more

[Solo]

A G A G (repeat)
